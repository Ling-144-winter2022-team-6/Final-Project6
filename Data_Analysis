 A. any of the python scripts or other data analysis tools that you used to gather and filter out your relevant data
  Python was process thorough "PyCharm" to filter the data. 
  Regex was used to filter the data. 
  Through regex, which can be accessed through 'consolidated_filter' file in the main, we changed all the "uh", "um" and "hmm" filler to "UHM" and added delimiter arounf "like" and "UHM" for the annotation in Google sheet. 
  Google sheet was used to annotate the filtered data, we seperated "like" and "UHM" using delimeters and one by one annotated their syntactical position in the sentence. 
  After filtering out the sentential position we made graph that shows the main difference between the "like" and "UHM".
