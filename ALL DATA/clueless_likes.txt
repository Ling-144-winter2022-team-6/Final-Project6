>CHER    So, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians    need to come to America. But some people are all "What about the strain    on our resources?" But it's LIKE, ---$--- when I had this garden party for    my father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner
>    But people came that LIKE, ---$--- did not R.S.V.P. so I was LIKE, ---$--- totally    buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish    in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was LIKE, ---$--- the more    the merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange    some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion,    may I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of    Liberty
>TRAVIS    OK, LIKE, ---$--- the way I feel about the Rolling Stones    is the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really    shouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh
>    I feel like such a heffer. I had two bowls of special K, three pieces of    turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn, five peanut butter M&M's, and LIKE, ---$---    three pieces of licorice
>TRAVIS    Oh, you like 'em? See, I was    thinking it was too cluttered. You know, I wanna wipe all of this out and    concentrate on one main decorative statement.  LIKE, ---$--- uh, Marvin the Martian
>CHER    Oh, God. Skateboards, that is    LIKE, ---$--- so five years ago
>    Later, while we were learning    about the Pismo Beach diaster, I decided I needed a complete make-over,    except this time I'd make-over my soul. But what makes someone a better    person? And then I realised, all my friends were really good in different    ways.  LIKE, ---$--- Christian, he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting
