>CHER    So, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians    need to come to America. But some people are all "What about the strain    on our resources?" But it's like, when I had this garden party for    my father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner
>    But people came that like, did not R.S.V.P. so I was like, totally    buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish    in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the more    the merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange    some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion,    may I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of    Liberty
>TRAVIS    OK, like, the way I feel about the Rolling Stones    is the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really    shouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh
>    I feel like such a heffer. I had two bowls of special K, three pieces of    turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn, five peanut butter M&M's, and like,    three pieces of licorice
>CHER    Oh, God. Skateboards, that is    like, so five years ago
