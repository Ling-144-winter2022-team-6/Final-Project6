INT. MOTEL. CALIFORNIA. EARLY MORNING.
One of those anonymous trucker motels along-side I-5 through
central California. It’s late summer, 2002. Two women sleep
together in a bed. Christine, aka Lady Bird, 17 years old.
Her Mom, Marion, the age of Lady Bird’s Mom. A modern-day
romantic Mary Cassatt rip-off painting of motherhood.
LADY BIRD (V.O.)
Do you think I look like I’m from
Sacramento?
CUT TO:
Now they’re awake. Lady Bird stares at her re. Marion makes
the bed.
MARION
You are from Sacramento.
LADY BIRD
(re: making the bed)
You don’t have to do that.
MARION
Well it’s nice to make things neat
and clean.
Marion is making hospital corners. Lady Bird sits on the
just made bed. Marion sits beside her, moves the hair out of
Lady Bird’s eyes.
MARION (CONT’D)
Ready to go home?
LADY BIRD
Ready.
INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. CALIFORNIA. DAY.
The last sentences of The Grapes of Wrath.
AUDIOBOOK
“Her hand moved behind his head and
supported it. Her fingers moved
gently in his hair. She looked up
and across the barn, and her lips
came together and smiled
mysteriously.” You have been
listening to ‘The Grapes of Wrath’
by John Steinbeck. If you...

Lady Bird ejects the tape, returns it to the case from the
public library. They are both crying.
LADY BIRD
(looking on the back)
Our college trip took 21 hours and
5 minutes.
They laugh and then wipe their tears. It’s a nice moment -
they both had the same emotion. Lady Bird immediately starts
looking for a good song on the radio.
MARION
(turning it off)
Hey, you know, let’s just
sit with what we heard?
LADY BIRD
(bristling)
Are you serious?
MARION
We don’t need to be constantly
entertaining ourselves, do we?
Lady Bird stares out the window, now sullen. Then:
LADY BIRD
I wish I could live through
something.
MARION
Aren’t you?
LADY BIRD
Nope. The only exciting thing about
2002 is that it’s a palindrome.
MARION
Ok fine, yours is the worst life of
all, you win.
LADY BIRD
Oh so now you’re mad? Because
I wanted to listen to music?
MARION
It’s just that you’re being
ridiculous, you have a
great life.
LADY BIRD
I’m sorry I’m not perfect.
MARION
Nobody is asking you to be perfect!
Just considerate would do.

LADY BIRD
(really picking a fight)
I don’t even want to go to school
in this state anyway, I hate
California. I want to go to the
East Coast.
MARION
Your Dad and I will barely be able
to afford in-state tuition.
LADY BIRD
There are loans, scholarships!
MARION
Your brother, your very smart
brother, can’t even find a job --
LADY BIRD
He and Shelly work. They have jobs.
MARION
THEY BAG AT THE GROCERY STORE.
That is not a career and they went
to BERKELEY.MARION
Your father’s company is laying people off right and left, did
you know that? No of course not because you don’t care about
anyone but yourself.
MARION
Immaculate Heart is already a
luxury.
LADY BIRD
Immaculate FART. You wanted that,
not me!
MARION
Miguel saw someone knifed in front
of him at Sac High, is that what
you want? You’re telling me that
you want to see someone knifed
right in front of you?
