Cady's father CHIP, 43, a lanky professorial type, takes a picture of
Cady and her mother BETSY, 43. (Betsy is attractive but not concerned
with style. The kind of woman who would still wear a fanny pack.)
CHIP
That's good. Stay close.
Betsy bursts into tears.
BETSY
My baby's going to school.
Cady comforts her mother.
CADY (V.O.)
I guess it's natural for parents to
cry on their kid's first day of
school. But this usually happens when
the kid is five.
Betsy has pulled Cady close and is hugging her.

CADY (V, O.)
I'm 15, and until today, I was home-
schooled. That means my mom was my
only teacher and my Dad was the only
sub. I know what you're thinking.
Home-schooled kids are freaks.

CADY (V.O.)
My favorite subject was always math.
CHIP
You're done with this chapter already?
Okay, let's start on those, um,

Chip climbs down to give Betsy a hug and a kiss.

Evanston was a lot like Africa.
Except in every single way.
They pull up across the street from Evanston High School.

I know you'll make us very proud.

Are you nervous? It's okay to be

Cadv starts across the street. She is almost hit by a big yellow
school bus. She jumps back as her mother yelps.
BETSY
CADY
I'm okay. Sorry. I'll be careful.
Cady crosses the street. Hip hop blares from a car radio.
Cady passes the different groups outside the school. A group of
black students sitting on the grass.

MR. DUVALL, the African American 10th grade dean enters. He looks
around for the homeroom teacher.
MR. DUVALL
Where's your teacher?
Their homeroom teacher, MS. SHARON NORBURY, enters. She is hip-
looking, 32. Bright but maybe not the most organized teacher.

They all look at her, disinterested.
MR. DUVALL

mad as I get when I think about the
fact that his name is Anfernee.
MS. NORBURY
